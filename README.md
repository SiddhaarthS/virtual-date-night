Single page website that I created to  collect preference when arranging a virtual date night. Uses supabase as backend database. The table that it stores information in, is given below for reference

create table public.responses (
  id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
  she_said_yes boolean null,
  date_preference jsonb null,
  notes text null,
  constraint responses_pkey primary key (id)
) TABLESPACE pg_default;
